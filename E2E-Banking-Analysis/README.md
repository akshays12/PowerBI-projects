# Banking Analytics Project

## Overview
This project involves end-to-end analysis of banking data, covering data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Power BI. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and create an interactive dashboard for banking operations.

## Files in the Repository
- **Banking.csv**: Contains the raw banking dataset.
- **notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with Python code for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
- **Banking_stats.pbix**: Power BI file containing the interactive dashboard for insights.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Process Workflow
### 1. **Data Cleaning**
   - The banking data (`Banking.csv`) is cleaned to remove inconsistencies and ensure data quality.
   - Python-SQL connector using **sqlalchemy** is used to load the cleaned data into a database.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Conducted using the **pandas**, **matplotlib** and **seaborn** libraries in Python.
   - Insights on trends, patterns, and anomalies within the data were identified.

### 3. **Dashboard and Insights**
   - Power BI is used to create an interactive dashboard.
   - The dashboard provides key metrics and visualizations for decision-making.

## Results
The project highlights:
- Key banking trends and metrics.
- Interactive visualizations for improved understanding.
- Data insights for actionable decision-making.
